## About me, with a guessing game
* A website that was made to show the visitor 5 questions about the site owner, with yes/no answers so the visitor can have some informations about the site owner, and it will add a comment about the answers if its correct or not. the js code was basically built by if statement, and for the html basic structure: one introductory pragaraph about the site owner.

* add question to ask how many cities you think I visit, out of Jordan?; takes only numbers; compare it to the correct no.
this done by using if statements inside a for loop.

* add equestion to ask about the cities that I visit; if the visitor answer one correct break the loop and give the auther correct answers; if not give him 6 attempts. 
this done by using 2 loops iside each others and an array

* add an ordered list having my Top ten series with GIF for each one.

### Reflections and Comments 
* Practicing on (if) statement in js.
* Practicing on normalizing the user input so that it can be validated, by making the code accepting the small and capital letters in the user answers, which problem that I used to face when I start coding.
* Reset the auto styling and built the style from the beginning , which is something I prefered especially to get rid of the auto margin and padding that the browser add.
* Adding .gitignore, .eslintec, MIT license files.
* practicing on loops 
* practicing on arrays

 **In this lab we worked together at first we saw the code, understood what the requirements of the lab then tried to do the first question with function**

 So, we have a lot of fun, tried to figure out the errors together also.
